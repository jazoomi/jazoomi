# Hello, I'm Juice

Software Engineer focused on backend systems, data workflows, and building tools that operate reliably at scale.

## 🚀 About Me

- SWE Intern working on production systems
- Experience contributing to multi-project environments (AI tooling, internal platforms, supply chain systems)
- Strong interest in system design, data integrity, and clean architecture
- Background in construction before transitioning into tech

I care about writing clear, maintainable code and understanding systems deeply — not just making them work.
